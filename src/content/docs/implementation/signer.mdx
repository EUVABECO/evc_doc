## Introduction

The signer is a component of the EVC software suite that enables the signing and generation of the EVC in a portable format.

This software is developed using the Ruby language and the following libraries:
- base45
- openssl
- cbor
- falcon
- rqrcode
- jwt
- rack

Each of these libraries is used to perform specific tasks, such as encoding and decoding data, signing data, and generating QR codes.

The signer exposes an API that allows for signing the EVC and generating QR codes. It is designed as **a toolbox** accessible through a JSON-RPC server that provides access to several procedures:
- sign
- generate QR code (SVG, PNG)
- zip data
- encode data in base45
- verify the signature
- etc.

These procedures allow anyone to use the signer to sign and generate a portable version of the EVC in any language with a default implementation.
This approach allows you to use the default implementation or to customize certain parts.
For example, you can use the signer to sign the EVC, return it as a base45 string, and generate the QR code on your side.

## APIs

The signer exposes two APIs:
- A JSON-RPC API
- A standard API to retrieve the public key

### JSON-RPC API
All procedures are exposed through the same endpoint: `POST` on `/jsonrpc`. The body of the request must be a JSON-RPC request.

Here is a list of the available procedures:
- `to_base_45`: Encode data in base45
- `to_cwt`: Generate an HCERT CWT
- `to_jwt`: Generate an HCERT JWT
- `to_zip`: Zip data
- `to_hcert`: Generate an HCERT (compressed CWT in base45)
- `to_hcert_qr_code`: Compressed CWT in base45 as a QR code
- `to_jwt_qr_code`: Compressed JWT in base45 as a QR code
- `pipeline`: A procedure that allows chaining several procedures
- `from_hcert`: Decode an HCERT and verify the signature

### Public Key API

The public key is exposed at the `/.well-known/jwks.json` endpoint.
It uses the [JWKS](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7517) format to expose the public key.

## Running the Signer

The simplest way to run the signer is to use the Docker image.

```bash
  docker build -t signer .
  docker run -p 3000:3000 signer
```

By default, the signer will listen on port 3000.
It boots using the `config.ru` file and uses an example key pair to sign the EVC.
You **must** use your own `config.ru` file to configure the signer with your own key pair.
The signer uses a basic interface for key pair storage that allows you to implement your own key store.
