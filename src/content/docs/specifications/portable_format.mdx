**Status:** <Badge text="Draft" variant="caution" size="medium" />


In its portable format, the CVE is represented as a CWT (CBOR Web Token), which is a binary-encoded, signed structure.
The CWT is a CBOR object that contains a set of claimsâ€”statements about the subject being identified.
These claims are encoded in the CWT as a set of name/value pairs, where the names are strings and the values are the corresponding claim values.
Claim values are described in the [schema section](/specifications/schema).

:::tip
CWT is the equivalent of JSON Web Tokens (JWT) but uses CBOR instead of JSON.
While JWT originates from the JOSE (JavaScript Object Signing and Encryption) standard, [CWT](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8392.txt) comes from the [COSE](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8152) (CBOR Object Signing and Encryption) standard.
:::

Using CBOR instead of JSON allows for a more compact representation of data, which is beneficial for QR code representation.
Large QR codes with medium redundancy capacity (supporting a loss of 15%) can only represent about 3,000 alphanumeric characters.

The CWT is then compressed using the [zlib](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1950) algorithm to reduce the size of the data stored in the QR code.

QR codes can store binary-encoded data, but some readers may have difficulty reading them.
Therefore, it is better to use alphanumeric encoding, which is more robust and increases interoperability.
To convert the binary data to alphanumeric data, we use Base45 encoding, a binary-to-text encoding scheme that uses a set of 45 printable ASCII characters to represent binary data. 
[Base45](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9285) appears to be the most compact encoding suitable for use with QR codes.

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Steps>

1. The **CVE** is converted to CBOR and signed as a **CWT**.
2. The **CWT** is compressed using the **zlib** algorithm.
3. The compressed **CWT** is encoded in **Base45**.
4. The **Base45** encoded data is stored in a **QR code**.
5. The **QR code** can be printed on a PDF.
