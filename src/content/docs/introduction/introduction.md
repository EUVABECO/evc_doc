description: What is the European Vaccination Card (EVC)?
---

The European Vaccination Card (EVC) is a portable, self-contained, dual format document provided to citizens to carry their vaccination history without loss of information across different health jurisdiction.

Its primary purpose is the continuity of care, allowing the health professionals to maintain the adequate level of protection of the person by having access to a reliable restitution of the vaccination history.

Its digital format allows to:

- translate automatically to any natural language
- upload the data to any electronic patient records application for sharing within a health facility or organization
- bind to informative resources about the received vaccines (ePIL)
- feed a Clinical Decision System (CDS) to know the next actions to be undertaken
- assess the authenticity of the record.
